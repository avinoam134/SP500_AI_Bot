This project was made by me following an online Machine Learning course.
It's ment to demonstrate my knowledge in Python Machine Learning coding using sklearn library:
- creating a basic model
- backtesting and improving accordingly.
- adjusting parameters for optimal decision trees
- improving data given for predictions and predictions method

I made the this project because i believe AI is the future of the universe and it highly intrigues me. I took it as a chance to explore more regarding the field
